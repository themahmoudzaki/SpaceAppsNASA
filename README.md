## Project Overview

**ExoPlanet Hunter AI** is a comprehensive, full-stack application designed to automate the discovery of exoplanets from NASA's vast open-source datasets. This project leverages a powerful stacking ensemble of machine learning models to analyze data from the **Kepler, K2, and TESS missions**, aiming to accurately classify planetary candidates.

The application is containerized using Docker and consists of three main parts:
1.  A **Machine Learning Core** for data processing and model training.
2.  A **Python Backend** to serve the trained model via a REST API.
3.  A **Web Frontend** for user interaction and data visualization.

## The Challenge

This project directly addresses the ["A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI"](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/a-world-away-hunting-for-exoplanets-with-ai/?tab=details) challenge from the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. The core objective is to create an AI/ML model with a web interface to facilitate user interaction and the discovery of new exoplanets.

## System Architecture

The entire application is designed to be run as a set of orchestrated services using Docker Compose, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and easy deployment.



1.  **Machine Learning Core (`backend/ml`)**
    * **Data Pipeline:** Ingests and processes raw data from NASA missions.
    * **Model Training:** Employs a stacking ensemble (XGBoost, LightGBM, MLP) to train a highly accurate classification model.
    * **Artifacts:** Produces a trained model file that is used by the backend service.

2.  **Backend (`backend`)**
    * **Technology:** A Python web framework (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) serves the application's logic.

3.  **Frontend (`frontend`)**
    * **Technology:** A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    * **Functionality:** Allows users to upload data, view classification results, and interact with visualizations.
    * **Communication:** Interacts with the backend via API calls to get predictions.
